### Phyllotaxis â€“ the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem

From Wikipedia: In botany, phyllotaxis or phyllotaxy is the arrangement of leaves on a plant stem. Phyllotactic spirals form a distinctive class of patterns in nature. The term was coined by Charles Bonnet to describe the arrangement of leaves on a plant.
