### Cardioid

This scratch project was inspired by [this coding challenge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bl3nc_a1nvs) from the coding train channel on YouTube.

Start by creating 6 variables called "angle", "count", "points", "radius", "x" and "y". Then create two lists called "x values" and "y values"

This first part of the scratch program will draw a number of points around a circle.
